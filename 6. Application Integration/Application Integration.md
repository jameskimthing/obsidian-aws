# Application Integration
- A suite of services that enable communication between:
	- Decoupled components within microservices
	- Distributed systems
	- Serverless applications
- Donâ€™t need to refactor your entire architecture to benefit
- **The Problem App Integration Solves**
	- *Application A* ---> *Application B*
	- *B* can expose a web (HTTP) API, built with [[API Gateway]] or [[AppSync]]
	- **Problems**
		- Overhead / extra work && costs
		- Same solution must be re-implemented many times
		- Connectivity between apps (& services) could be an issue
