- A service that provides automation and management of the infrastructure and services, making it easier to deploy and scale your application

- *In relation to [[CodePipeline]]:*
	- Can use [[CodePipeline]] to automate the delivery of your code, and use *OpsWorks* to manage and configure the infrastructure and services required for your application
	- Can also use both services together to create a complete pipeline for deploying and scaling your applications in the cloud
