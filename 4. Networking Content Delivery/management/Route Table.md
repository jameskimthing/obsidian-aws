- Contains a set of rules, called *routes*, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed

> A route table is like a map for a computer, it tells the computer where to send different kinds of information.

>Imagine you're going on a trip, you're the computer and the trip is the information you want to send to somewhere. And you have a map that shows the different paths you can take to get to your destination. Some paths take you through a big city, some take you through a mountain, and some take you through a forest. But depending on where you want to go, you'll want to take a different path.

>A route table is similar to that map. It has a list of different paths that the computer can take to send information, and depending on where the information needs to go, the computer will take the appropriate path. This way the computer can make sure the information is delivered to the right place, just like you can make sure you get to your destination using the map.
