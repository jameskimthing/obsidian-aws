![[Serverless Concept.png]]
- A cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage server
- A method of providing backend services on an as-used basis

#### Advantages
- **Lower costs** --> Serverless computing is generally very cost-effective
	- Traditional cloud providers of backend services (server allocation) often result in the user paying for unused space or idle CPU time
- **Simplified scalability** --> Developers donâ€™t have to worry about policies to scale up their code
- **Simplified backend code**Can significantly cut time to market
	- Instead of needing a complicated deploy process to roll out bug fixes and new features, developers can add and modify code on a piecemeal basis

#### Disadvantages
- **Cold Start** --> The set-up time required to get a serverless application's environment up and running when it is invoked for the first time within a defined period
