# Simple Storage Service
![[Pasted image 20230405131924.png]]
- Focus on the file, not the underlying system
- Store any kind of file, with (almost) any kind of size
- For faster content delivery, can utilize [[S3TA]]

#### File Storage
- Upload, delete, & read.. via console, CLI, HTTP API, SDK, etc...

#### Buckets
- Files are organized in buckets ("folders")
- Buckets are regional
- Unique name required for each bucket
- Can create as many buckets as needed

#### No File System
- Flat Structure, no directories
- Prefixes help with organizing files

#### Detailed Permissions System
- Control Bucket (and file) level access
- Via Bucket Policies (*Recommended*)
- Via ACLs (not recommended)

## Advanced Features
- **Versioning** = Store multiple versions of a file
- **Lifecycle Management** = Transition files between classes
	- Can set transition rules that define when objects are moved to a different storage class
	- This allows you to assign objects (files) to different storage classes based on changing access patterns
- **Inventory && Analytics** = Understand stored files && data
- **Compliance && Object Lock** = Prevent object deletion / changes
- **Replication** = Replicate objects cross-bucket (for backup)
- **Data Protection && Encryption** = Automatically encrypt stored daat
- **Static Website Hosting** = Upload && host (static) website files

# Storage Classes
- Check [here](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/134/play/62437/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials)
|                       | Frequent Access                      | Infrequent Access                | Archive                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**              | Highest flexibility, no cost savings | Cost savings, but retrieval cost | High cost savings, but less flexibility |
| Access Frequency e.g. | Every second / minute                | Only from time to time           | Almost never accessed                   |
| Instant Access        | Required                             | Possible                         | Not always possible                     |

The *Archive* access pattern is about the [[S3 Glacier]]s

#### S3 Intelligent Tiering

- AWS will analyze the access patterns, and will automatically move it in a fitting storage class (of course saves less than configuring manually, but may be worth)
