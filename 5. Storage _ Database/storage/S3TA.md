# S3 Transfer Acceleration
- Reduces the variability in Internet routing, congestion and speeds that can affect transfers, and logically shortens the distance to [[S3]] for remote applications
- Improves transfer performance by routing traffic through:
	- The globally distributed [[Edge Locations]]
	- AWS' [[Global Network]]
	- Network protocol optimizations
