- Run big data applications and petabyte-scale data analytics faster, and at less than half the cost of on-premises solutions

*Easier Explanation:*
>Imagine you have a big pile of papers, and you want to find a specific one. It would take you a long time to go through the whole pile yourself, right? But what if you had a group of friends to help you? They could each take a smaller pile, look through it, and tell you if they found the paper you were looking for. That would be much faster!

> AWS EMR is like having a group of friends to help you with a big pile of data. Instead of looking through all the data yourself, EMR can spread the work out over lots of computers, so it can be done faster. It's a service provided by AWS which helps you to process large amount of data using Hadoop and Spark ecosystem
